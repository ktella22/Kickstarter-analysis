# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
This Excel project introducted data analysis and visualization by introducting useful functions and formulas such as Countif or Filter function to narrow down the targeted values and parameters from large datasets spreadsheet. Also generating charts and graphs, and interpretting pivot tables to visualize the relationship between two models are helpful for data analysis purposes.

- familiar with different functions and Excel formulas for data analysis. To read the new columns, filter the value of interests and formatting the cells.    

## Analysis and Challenges
Modules 1 lectures are very informative and prepared me to peform for the required analysis. 
code and graphs
explain and write about what challenges.  

The lectures cover most of the challenge directory. The only diffuculities I met was Countif but the video was helpful to understand and create the formula to get the solutions very quickly. It took a while to understand the specific formula and syntax like "$" or "!" in order or else the error responds will return it back right away. 


## Results
- According to the theater Outcomes by Launch Data plot, the month of May has the highest success outcomes for Theater category from the Kickstarter spreadsheet. However, December month would not be a good time for Theater to launch because the failed rate is as close as their success rate in December so that 

During the month of May, the success rate is the highest based on the percentage funded. It is the most ideal time for the Theater launch date. As holiday seasons approaches from October, there is a steady decline in the success rate. In the month of December, the chance of hitting the goal will be as close as the failing it. 

Second and third quarter, fialed rate is very stable. Easy to predict the time to lauch ??

- The plots representing percentage success rate and failed rates are inverted to each other. It is a high risk setting the higher goals and the outcomes will be a higher failing rate. In order to get at least 50% success rate, the goal should be set between  $35,000 to 45,000 or less than $15,000. 

- Theater outcomes based on Launch data plot tells us that there are no regard to Canceling event on October month. With this missing data, the useful information can be left out from the analysis.

- It is also interesting to add the graph about percentage funded based on Parent category. It would help the viewers to see which category was funded higher or lower. Additonal pivot table such as the goals according to the country
